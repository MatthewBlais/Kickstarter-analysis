# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
#### 1. Overview of Project 
Louise has begun raising money for her play _Fever_ and is close to meeting her fundraising goal on Kickstarter. My goal is to analyze and interperet data from Kickstarter for Louise to help her understand any relationship between the succsess rate of previous campaigns and both their launch dates and funding goals. 
#### 2. Analysis and Challenges
I began this analysis by creating a pivot table out of the Kickstarter data. This table broke down how many Kickstarters under the Parent Category Theater were successful, failed, and canceled between the years 2016 - 2014. See Screenshot below
